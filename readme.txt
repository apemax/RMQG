This is the readme file for the Random Maths Question Generator or RMQG.

The zip file that RMQG comes in contains the source code for RMQG as well as the executable. The source code can be found in the RMQG-src.zip file thats in the RMQG-V0.5.1.zip file.

The Random Maths Question Generator or RMQG for short is as you would have guessed it a program that generates rondom maths questions. Its fairly basic at the moment but hopefully it will get better.

To use it all you need to do is when it asks you what type of question you would like to do type in either 1 for basic questions followed by what type of basic question you want to do or 2 for decimal questions followed by what type of decimal question you would like to do. Here's a couple of examples:

Typing in 11 would make it show you a basic multiply question.

Typing in 21 would make it show you a decimal multiply question.

You get it now? Fairly simple isn't it? If you have any questions about this program please email me at apemax18@gmail.com.
