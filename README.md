# Random Maths Question Generator or RMQG.

The Random Maths Question Generator or RMQG for short is as you would have guessed it a program that generates rondom maths questions. Its fairly basic at the moment but hopefully it will get better.

## Usage

To use it all you need to do is when it asks you what type of question you would like to do type in either 1 for basic questions followed by what type of basic question you want to do or 2 for decimal questions followed by what type of decimal question you would like to do. Here's a couple of examples:

Typing in 11 would make it show you a basic multiply question.

Typing in 21 would make it show you a decimal multiply question.

You get it now? Fairly simple isn't it?
