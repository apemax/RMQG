# Random Maths Question Generator or RMQG

The Random Maths Question Generator or RMQG for short is as you would have guessed it a program that generates rondom maths questions.

## Usage

### Casual mode

When it asks you what type of question you would like to do type in either 1 for basic questions followed by what type of basic question you want to do or 2 for decimal questions followed by what type of decimal question you would like to do. Here's a couple of examples:

Typing in 11 would make it show you a basic multiply question.

Typing in 21 would make it show you a decimal multiply question.

### Challenge mode
